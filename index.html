            <p><strong>I had some thoughts tonight and wanted to share this from me.</strong> Not from anything AI generated. Just from me, grammatical errors and all.</p>

            <p>One of the very few concerns I have heard during my campaign for sheriff is my ability to run an organization as complicated as the Rhea County Sheriff’s Office. I want to take a moment to address those concerns.</p>

            <p>From the time I began college, I was working as an auxiliary/reserve officer for the Rhea County Sheriff’s Office and Spring City Police Department. I first began as an auxiliary deputy under Leon Sneed during his last term as sheriff. During the transition from his administration to Mike Neal’s administration, I moved to the Spring City Police Department to work as a reserve officer. After roughly six months, I spoke to Sheriff Mike Neal and returned to the sheriff’s office as a reserve deputy.</p>

            <p>During the time of working at both departments, I was attending the University of Tennessee and Chattanooga State Community College. I ended up majoring in General Management, which is a business focus, at Chattanooga State. While attending college, I spent most of my free time volunteering as a reserve at both previously mentioned departments. I was able to experience day to day operations on road patrol and within the jail at the sheriff’s office. I spent many valuable hours there learning about multiple facets of law enforcement.</p>

            <p>I graduated with honors from Chattanooga State with an associate degree in General Management. It included classes in language arts, public speaking, business law, business math, accounting, financial management, statistics, psychology, and multiple other college level courses. I had originally planned on that degree being a fallback plan in case my law enforcement career didn’t pan out. Little did I know, it would help advance my career in law enforcement as a supervisor.</p>

            <p>I worked full time for the Rhea County Sheriff’s Office for two and a half years after I graduated college. During that time, I worked in corrections and as a patrol deputy. I worked multiple districts in the county and became very familiar with all of the communities of Rhea County. During my time as a reserve officer, corrections officer, and patrol deputy, I was able to gain a wealth of knowledge on the everyday workings of a police officer.</p>

            <p>I married my wife, Megan Madewell Jordan in March of 2006. With plans of a future family, I had to look at what would be best for raising our children. In August of 2006, I accepted a job with the Dayton Police Department. I worked as a patrol officer on night shift, before accepting a position as a patrol sergeant on night shift. While my wife and I raised our children, I accepted a position as a school resource officer at Bryan College so I could be on a shift more aligned with my family’s schedule. That gave me five years of invaluable experience, learning the ins and outs of both college campus life and schools in general.</p>

            <p>After those five years working as a school resource officer at Bryan College, I had the opportunity to move back to road patrol on day shift. I could not pass that chance, as working on the road dealing with day to day issues was where my passion really was. I was able to interact with the community, help people in times of need, apprehend those who had committed crimes, and truly feel like I was making a positive impact within my community.</p>

            <p>I later moved into a supervisor role as a patrol sergeant on day shift for the Dayton Police Department. In that time, I have tried to share both the successes and mistakes I have made with other officers working with me. I have always tried to stress to them to treat people with respect until they force the situation otherwise. We want to be able to approach every situation with that respect, but it doesn’t realistically always happen that way. All of these experiences have taught me to approach everything with balance and an open mind.</p>

            <p>I don’t bring up any of this to get a pat on the back or an “atta boy”. I point it out to show that I have a wide variety of experiences and certifications in law enforcement. Combine that with my college education in business and extensive life experiences, it has given me a wealth of knowledge in potentially being your next sheriff of Rhea County.</p>

            <p>I am a very fast learner, and very particular about details in anything I do. I want to make sure things are done correctly and that I do right by people. If elected Sheriff of Rhea County, we will get better at our job every day, and instill a relationship of trust within our community.</p>

            <p>Ego will never stand in the way of what I want for my department and Rhea County as a whole.</p>
