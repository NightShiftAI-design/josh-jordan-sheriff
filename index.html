        <h2>Josh Jordan Announces Candidacy for Rhea County Sheriff</h2>

        <p><strong>My name is Josh Jordan, and I am formally announcing my intent to run for Sheriff of Rhea County, Tennessee.</strong></p>

        <p>
          I am 43 years old and have proudly called Rhea County my home for my entire life.
          I have been married for 19 years and raise my children here.
          I am a graduate of Rhea County High School, Class of 2000, and earned an
          Associate of Applied Science degree in Business from Chattanooga State,
          graduating with honors.
        </p>

        <p>
          My commitment to public service began early. While attending college, I volunteered
          as a Reserve Police Officer with the Spring City Police Department and as a Reserve
          Deputy with the Rhea County Sheriff’s Office. In January 2004, I began my full-time
          career in law enforcement as a Corrections Deputy with the Rhea County Sheriff’s Office
          and was later promoted to Patrol Deputy after attending the Police Academy.
        </p>

        <p>
          In August 2006, I accepted a position with the Dayton Police Department, where I
          currently serve as a Patrol Sergeant. Over the course of my career, I have served as
          a Patrol Officer, School Resource Officer, and Patrol Sergeant. In my current role,
          I train new officers, coordinate schedules, assist with departmental planning,
          serve as the Reporting Agency Coordinator for TBI crime data compliance,
          and manage the department’s report database.
        </p>

        <p>
          I have investigated nearly every type of crime, including domestic violence,
          DUIs, drug-related offenses, homicide, sex trafficking, and crisis situations.
          These experiences led me to a deep commitment to mental health response.
          In December 2023, I became a certified Crisis Intervention Team (CIT) officer
          and have since built strong partnerships with Rhea Mental Health and
          Volunteer Behavioral Health.
        </p>

        <p>
          I love this county and care deeply about the people who live here.
          It would be my honor to bring my experience, leadership, and passion for service
          to the role of Sheriff. I believe in leading by example, listening to the community,
          and working every day to keep Rhea County safe while supporting our deputies
          and strengthening community partnerships.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Thank you for your time, support, and consideration.</strong></p>
