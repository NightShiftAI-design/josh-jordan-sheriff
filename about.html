          “My name is Josh Jordan, and I am formally announcing my intent to run for Sheriff of Rhea County, Tennessee.”

          <p style="margin:0; color: var(--muted); line-height:1.75;">
            I am 43 years old and have proudly called Rhea County my home for my entire life. I have been married for 19 years and raise my children here.
            I am a graduate of Rhea County High School, Class of 2000, and went on to earn an Associate of Applied Science degree in Business from Chattanooga State,
            graduating with honors.
            <br><br>
            My commitment to public service began early. While attending college, I volunteered as a Reserve Police Officer with the Spring City Police Department and
            as a Reserve Deputy with the Rhea County Sheriff’s Office.
            In January 2004, I began my full-time career in law enforcement as a Corrections Deputy with the Rhea County Sheriff’s Office. I was later promoted to Patrol Deputy and attended the Police Academy.
            In August 2006, I accepted a position with the Dayton Police Department, where I currently serve as a Patrol Sergeant.
            <br><br>
            As a Patrol Sergeant, I have been responsible for training new officers, coordinating schedules, and helping plan departmental goals.
            I also serve as the Reporting Agency Coordinator for TBI crime data compliance and manage our department’s report database.
            <br><br>
            I love this county and care deeply about the people who live here. It would be my honor to bring my years of experience, leadership, and passion for service to the role of Sheriff.
            I believe in leading by example, listening to the needs of the community, and continually growing as both an officer and a servant to the public.
